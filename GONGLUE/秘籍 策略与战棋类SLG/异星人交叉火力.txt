The energy reserve {money} locations for the various factions are located as listed, when using the Huge Map option and Symantec’ or Norton’s Diskedit software:

Doma Faction at offset 27,464
Roze Faction at offset 35,860

Changing energy reserve to {for example}:
99 99 99

gives you over 10 million credits, which is more than enought to purchase each advancement or new units as soon as they become available.

The cheat in hex does not flag the game for winning by cheating as does the use of the built-in cheat options.
