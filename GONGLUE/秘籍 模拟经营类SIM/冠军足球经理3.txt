控制国家队

以英格兰为例，开始新游戏选择俱乐部队时，或在游戏中选择Add Manager后选择俱乐部队时，任意选择一家俱乐部，再选择任意一名本土球员(在本例中也就是英格兰籍的球员)查看他的详细资料，这时他的国籍显示England,单击England，就出现英格兰国家队，再选择Take Control，就可以控制英格兰国家队了。其他国家与此相同。

Free Players

First, when you find a player you want, start a second team who have enough money to buy him (Arsenal, or Man Utd are good bets) then, with the team you want to buy him for, place an offer of ￡0 for him.
Then, with the second team, place an offer of the amount the club want for him.
Having done this, go to adjust offer with the same team, and near the top left corner will be a little arrow click it and your team name should be there, click that, and hey presto, you have control of whether to accept the first offer or not. But don’t forget to withdraw the second offer of the right amount

Players for free

Go to the player you want to buy. Put an offer in for twice as much as his value,they will accept, you go to ’adjust offer’, put your offer down to free and press cancel.

1. Go to the player you want to buy e.g. Michael Owen
