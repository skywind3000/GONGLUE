Easy Money: Bug Exploitation  
These best way to use this bug is to go to a puzzle sideshow that has a low play cost. WHILE somebody is playing up the play cost to $10,000 (make sure you hit the confirm check to get that price activated!). When they finish the puzzle you will get the 10k instead of the lower play cost they started playing at. Nobody will play it at 10k, so lower the price back down to a fair price. You can do this as often as you want. Puzzle sideshow works best because it gives you time to raise the price while the customer is playing.

**Power money tip** 
Start a small park with 4 puzzle games close together, 2 rides, 1 food, 1 bathroom and a gate price of $0. If you set it up so all 4 puzzle are within view of each other, you can do the global price raise/lower for all puzzles when all 4 are active (making 40k a pop) The $0 gate price gets them in fast. Set the prizes value to $10 and a maximum win possibility. That makes them happy, stay longer and play more.
